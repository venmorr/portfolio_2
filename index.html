          "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." My first steps were with General Assembely, a coding boot camp where not only did I learn the fundementals of software development and web design, but learned how to learn. With this course under my belt I was able to reach new heights of creativity I had never believed possible.

      <p class="about-me-text">
        Hello, I'm Steven Morrison, a creative mind with a passion for bringing ideas to life through software development. My journey into the world of coding began as a pursuit of a powerful tool for creation, and I quickly realized it was my best avenue for shaping the future.
      </p>

      <p class="about-me-text">
        What sets me apart is the unique lens through which I view the world. Living with dyslexia has not only presented challenges but has also granted me the ability to think non-linearly. This distinctive perspective fuels my creativity and enables me to uncover solutions to problems that others might not see.
      </p>

      <p class="about-me-text">
        Having spent the last 8 years in the field of education, I've honed my skills in working collaboratively and developed a keen attention to detail. These experiences have not only enriched my understanding of teamwork but have also instilled in me the importance of precision in every aspect of my work.
      </p>

      <p class="about-me-text">
        Join me on a journey where creativity meets functionality, and let's build something extraordinary together.
